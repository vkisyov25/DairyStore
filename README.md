â”‚ â””â”€â”€ ... # Service & Impl classes for each domain
â”œâ”€â”€ Utils/ # Utility classes (e.g. JwtUtil)
â”œâ”€â”€ Validations/ # Custom validators (EIK, seller fields)
â””â”€â”€ DairyStoreApplication # Main Spring Boot entry point

src/main/resources/
â”œâ”€â”€ static/
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ css/ # Stylesheets for pages
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ html/ # Public-facing HTML templates
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ js/ # Frontend logic using Vanilla JS
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ images/ # UI images and backgrounds
â”œâ”€â”€ templates/ # Server-side rendered HTML templates
â””â”€â”€ application.properties # Spring Boot configuration

The backend follows a layered architecture with clear separation of concerns:
- Controllers â†’ Services â†’ Repositories â†’ DB
- Business logic is encapsulated in services (with Impl classes)
- DTOs and Validators handle data transfer and input correctness
- Strategy Pattern is used for analytics logic (buyers/sellers)

The frontend is structured using static HTML, JS, and CSS, organized per user role.
